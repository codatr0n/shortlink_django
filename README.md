# Shortlinks with trackers
Shortlink service with the ability to upload 3rd party tracking pixels like re-targeting pixels or Google Analytics, so you can build a remarketing audience based on the users who click your shortlinks.

This is my first attempt at building a small webservice in __Django__

TODO:
- Finish adding bootstrap css
